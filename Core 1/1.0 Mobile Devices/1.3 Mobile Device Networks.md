## Cellular networks
- **Mobile devices**
	- "Cell" phones
	- Cellular networks that we use to be able to communicate to using phones.
- **Separate land into "cells"**
	- An antenna covers a cell with certain frequencies
- **Enable or disable voice and/or data communication**
	- Airplane mode disables all cellular networks
	- Could also disable data but keep voice

## 3G technology
- **3rd generation**
	- Introduced in 1998
	- Where cellular technology started taking off
- **Upgraded data connectivity**
	- Incremental 3G updates improved speeds
	- Usually, several *megabits (Mb or Mbit)* per second
- **Bandwidth improvement allowed new functionality**
	- GPS
	- Mobile television
	- Video on demand
	- Video conferencing

## 4G and LTE
- **Long Term Evolution (LTE)**
	- A "4G" technology
	-   Based on **GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)** and **EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)**
	- Standard supports download rates of *150 Mbit/s*
- **LTE Advanced (LTE-A)**
	- Standard supports download rates of *300 Mbit/s*

## 5G
- **Fifth-generation cellular networking**
	- Launched worldwide in 2020
- **Significant performance improvements**
	- At higher frequencies
	- Eventually *10 gigabits per second*
	- Slower speeds from *100-900 Mbit/s*
- **Significant IoT (Internet of Things) impact**
	- Bandwidth becomes less of a constraint
	- Larger data transfers
	- Faster monitoring and notification
	- Additional cloud processing

## Wi-Fi
- **Connect to a local 802.11 network**
	- Data access for email and the internet
	- Higher speeds, no cellular bandwidth use
- **Requires a local access point**
	- Limited distance coverage
- **May also support voice communication**
	- Wi-Fi calling
	- Requires support from the voice carrier
	- Very useful when cellular coverage may not be available

## Hotspot
- **Turn your phone into a WiFi hotspot**
	- Your own personal wireless router
	- Extend the cellular data network to all of your devices
	- You can take your phone anywhere and have anyone connect to your phone for internet access (over 802.11)
- **Dependent on phone type and provider**
	- May require additional charges and data costs

## Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)
- **A unique identifier for cellular devices**
	- Often, a tiny physical card
	- Replace the SIM, and the phone will have a new number
- **Contains information for the carrier and user (the subscriber)**
	- SIM ID and phone number
	- Cellular network information
	- Storage space for contacts, messages, etc.
- **eSIM - embedded SIM**
	- Newer phones no longer need a physical SIM card
	- SIM is inside the device
	- Cannot be physically removed
		- But it can be moved to a different phone using the software on the device
- **Many devices support multiple SIMs**
	- There are many phone devices that can support more than 1 physical SIM card, or dual-SIM

## Bluetooth pairing
- **Connect a Bluetooth device**
	- Built-in security
		- It not only ensures security but also lets you connect to that device automatically later.
	- Requires PIN (Personal Identification Number) to use or verify connectivity for initial setup
- **Pair the device one time**
	- Future connections should be automatic
	- Once paired, you can freely connect/ disconnect the device without having to do the pairing setup again
	- The Bluetooth pairing process is very similar between devices
		- There may be nuances or differences depending on the device you're connecting to.
		- Check your documentation, know the appropriate PIN, or find that information on your Bluetooth device

### Bluetooth pairing process
- **Enable Bluetooth on both devices**
	- Android and iOS: Settings -> Bluetooth
- **Set devices to discoverable mode**
	- May require a key sequence on the Bluetooth device
	- Check the documentation on the BT device on how to make it discoverable
- **Select the discovered device**
	- Other devices may appear!
- **Enter or confirm PIN**
	- Should be the same on both devices
	- PIN may be embedded into the device, or dynamically change when connecting to a new device each time
- **Test connectivity**
	- Devices should now communicate
	- You can test by powering down the device and powering it on again to see if it will automatically reconnect

## GPS (Global Positioning System)
- **Created by the U.S. Department of Defense**
	- Over 30 satellites are currently in orbit
- **Precise navigation**
	- Need to see at least 4 satellites
- **Determines location based on timing differences**
	- Longitude, latitude, altitude
- **Mobile device location services and geotracking**
	- Maps, directions
	- Determine physical location based on GPS, WiFi, and cellular towers
		- GPS is not the only way to determine your location
